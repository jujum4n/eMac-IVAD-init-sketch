# eMac-IVAD-init-sketch

#### Description
Using https://github.com/qbancoffee/emac_ivad_board_init as a guide, I modified the script to simply send the Init after 7 seconds have elapsed.

Will update this to contain new versions as I add more functionality, Buttons etc.

### Todo
-   Create a version with push button to send Init
